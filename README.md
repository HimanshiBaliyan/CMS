# Customer Management System (CMS) Project Report

## Overview

The Customer Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate efficient management of customer data for businesses. This system provides a set of APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting customer information. The CMS is built using the Go programming language and the GoFr framework, offering a robust and scalable solution for customer data management.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The system supports standard CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete customer records.

- **Database Integration:** CMS integrates with a MySQL database for persistent storage of customer data. It automates tasks such as connection pooling and retry mechanisms.

- **Unit Tests:** The project maintains a minimum of 60% unit test coverage to ensure the reliability and stability of the codebase.

- **Real-World Scenario:** The CMS project is designed around a real-world scenario, mimicking a customer database where businesses can add, view, update, and remove customer records.
