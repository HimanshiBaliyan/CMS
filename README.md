# Customer Management System (CMS) Project Report

## Overview

The Customer Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate efficient management of customer data for businesses. This system provides a set of APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting customer information. The CMS is built using the Go programming language and the GoFr framework, offering a robust and scalable solution for customer data management.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The system supports standard CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete customer records.

- **Database Integration:** CMS integrates with a MySQL database for persistent storage of customer data. It automates tasks such as connection pooling and retry mechanisms.

- **Unit Tests:** The project maintains a minimum of 60% unit test coverage to ensure the reliability and stability of the codebase.

- **Real-World Scenario:** The CMS project is designed around a real-world scenario, mimicking a customer database where businesses can add, view, update, and remove customer records.

## Use Cases

## 1. Add Customer

### Objective
Allow businesses to add new customer records to the system.

### Steps
1. The business sends a POST request to the `/customer` endpoint with the necessary customer details.
2. The CMS validates the incoming data and inserts the new customer record into the database.
3. A success response is returned to the business, confirming the addition of the customer.

## 2. View Customer List

### Objective
Enable businesses to retrieve a list of all existing customers.

### Steps
1. The business sends a GET request to the `/customer` endpoint.
2. The CMS queries the database for the list of customers.
3. The list of customers is returned to the business as a JSON response.

## 3. Update Customer Details

### Objective
Allow businesses to update the details of an existing customer.

### Steps
1. The business sends a PUT request to the `/customer/{id}` endpoint, specifying the customer ID to be updated.
2. The CMS retrieves the existing customer details from the database.
3. The system updates the customer information based on the provided data.
4. A success response is returned to the business, confirming the update.

## 4. Remove Customer

### Objective
Enable businesses to remove a customer record from the system.

### Steps
1. The business sends a DELETE request to the `/customer/{id}` endpoint, specifying the customer ID to be removed.
2. The CMS checks if the customer exists in the database.
3. If the customer is found, the system deletes the customer record.
4. A success response is returned to the business, confirming the removal of the customer.
